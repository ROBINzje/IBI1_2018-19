Assume there are n elements in the current list. The whole process takes time T(n).
The number of combination of 2 elements: n*(n-1)
For each combination do resursion which needs time T(n-1).
The worst situation is no 24 can be found: T(n)=n*(n-1)*T(n-1)*6 because there are 6 'if' loops
So T(n)=n*(n-1)!^2*6^(n-1)
Algorithm complexity O(n)=(n-1)!^2
